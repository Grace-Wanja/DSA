    "- 2. **Abstract Data Types (ADT) and Data Structures**\n",
    "- An ADT is a model that defines operations and behaviors for a data type without specifying how these are implemented or how data is stored. ADT only mentions what operations are to be performed but not how these operations will be implemented. It does not specify how data will be organized in memory and what algorithms will be used for implementing the operations. It is called “abstract” because it provides an implementation-independent view. They are known as adstract because they only provide the essentials and hide the details a process called abstruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- i). The Role of Abstract Data Types in Programming\n",
    "  - ADTs are used to create fast algorithms in less time.\n",
    "  - they help to manage and organize the data.\n",
    "  - they make code clean and easy to understand.\n",
    "  - they make the execution program fast and consume less time\n",
    "- A user does not need to know the hidden implementation as long as the data is being entered and obtained correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ii). Difference between ADTs and Data Structures\n",
    "  - An Abstract Data Type is a conceptual(basic layout) model that defines the operations and behavior of a data type without specifying how it's implemented, while\n",
    " a Data structure is the concrete implementation of that data type, detailing how the data is stored and accessed in memory. \n",
    "  - An ADT describes what a data structure can do, while the data structure defines how it does it. \n",
    "  - An ADT defines the operations that can be performed on data (like adding, removing, searching) without specifying the underlying mechanics while a data structure focuses on implementation such as how to organize data in memory, like using an array, linked list, or tree, to efficiently execute the operations defined by an ADT. \n",
    "\n",
    "- iii). Examples of ADTs and how they are implemented in programming languages\n",
    "   - a)List ADT\n",
    "    - The List ADT needS to store the required data in a sequence and should have the following operations:\n",
    "      - get():to return an element from the list at any given position.\n",
    "      - insert():to insert an element at any position in the list.\n",
    "      - remove():to remove the first occurrence of any element from a non-empty list.\n",
    "      - removeAt():to remove the element at a specified location from a non-empty list.\n",
    "      - replace():to replace an element at any position with another element.\n",
    "      - size():to return the number of elements in the list.\n",
    "      - isEmpty():to return true if the list is empty; otherwise, return false.\n",
    "      - isFull():to return true if the list is full; otherwise, return false\n",
    "\n",
    "   - b)Stack ADT\n",
    "    - In Stack ADT, the order of insertion and deletion should be according to the FILO or LIFO Principle. Elements are inserted and removed from the same end, called the top of the stack. It should also support the following operations:\n",
    "      - push(): Insert an element at one end of the stack called the top.\n",
    "      - pop(): Remove and return the element at the top of the stack, if it is not empty.\n",
    "      - peek(): Return the element at the top of the stack without removing it, if the stack is not empty.\n",
    "      - size(): Return the number of elements in the stack.\n",
    "      - isEmpty(): Return true if the stack is empty; otherwise, return false.\n",
    "      - isFull(): Return true if the stack is full; otherwise, return false.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - c)Queue ADT\n",
    "     - The Queue ADT follows a design similar to the Stack ADT, but the order of insertion and deletion changes to FIFO. Elements are inserted at one end (called the rear) and removed from the other end (called the front). It should support the following operations:\n",
    "      - enqueue(): Insert an element at the end of the queue.\n",
    "      - dequeue(): Remove and return the first element of the queue, if the queue is not empty.\n",

    "\n",
    "   - head-the first node in a linked list\n",
    "   - tail-the last node in a linked list\n",
    "- Stacks; A stack is a data structure that can hold many elements\n",
    "  - Stacks can be implemented by using arrays or linked lists. uses the LIFO(last in first out) style of organizing data\n",
    "- Queues; A queue is a data structure that can hold many elements.\n",
    "  - Queues can be implemented by using arrays or linked lists. Queues use the FIFO(First In First Out) way of organizing elements\n",
    "- Recursion; Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself repeatedly until it reaches a base case that stops the recursion\n",
    "- Trees; A tree is a hierarchical data structure, where each node has a value and zero or more child nodes. a child node is a node that is directly connected to another node, called the parent node. The Tree data structure is similar to Linked Lists in that each node contains data and can be linked to other nodes.\n",
    "- Graphs; A Graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of vertices (nodes) and edges.A vertex, also called a node, is a point or an object in the Graph, and an edge is used to connect two vertices with each other. Graphs are non-linear because the data structure allows us to have different paths to get from one vertex to another, unlike with linear data structures like Arrays or Linked Lists.\n",
