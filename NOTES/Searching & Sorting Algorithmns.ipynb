    "### 1. LINEAR SEARCH\n",
    "- Linear search is also known as sequential search.\n",
    "- this search algorithm traverses a list or array sequentially to find the target element.\n",
    "- Linear search algorithm iterates through each element in the list or array, comparing it with the target element until a match is found or the end of the list is reached. If the end of the list is reached, then it means that the target element is not present in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "- HOW IT WORKS:\n",
    "  - In Linear Search, we iterate over all the elements of the array and check if the current element is equal to the target element. If we find any element to be equal to the target element, then return the index of the current element. Otherwise, if no element is equal to the target element, then return -1 as the element is not found.\n",
    "For example: Consider the array , \n",
    "\n",
    "Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4], x = 3\n",
    "Output: 2\n",
    "Explanation: There is one test case with array as [1, 2, 3 4] and element to be searched as 3. Since 3 is present at index 2, the output is 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: arr[] = [10, 8, 30], x = 6\n",
    "Output: -1\n",
    "Explanation: The element to be searched is 6 and its not present, so we return -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Applications of Linear search\n",
    "  - Unsorted Lists: When we have an unsorted array or list, linear search is most commonly used to find any element in the collection.\n",
    "  - Small Data Sets: Linear Search is preferred over binary search when we have small data sets with\n",
    "  - Searching Linked Lists: In linked list implementations, linear search is commonly used to find elements within the list. Each node is checked sequentially until the desired element is found.\n",
    "  - Simple Implementation: Linear Search is much easier to understand and implement as compared to Binary Search or Ternary Search."

    "- Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "HOW IT WORKS;\n",
    "- It works by recursively dividing the input array into smaller subarrays and sorting those subarrays then merging them back together to obtain the sorted array.\n",
    "- The process of merge sort is to divide the array into two halves, sort each half, and then merge the sorted halves back together. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a step-by-step explanation of how merge sort works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Divide:  Divide the list or array recursively into two halves until it can no more be divided. \n",
    "- Conquer:  Each subarray is sorted individually using the merge sort algorithm. \n",
    "- Merge:  The sorted subarrays are merged back together in sorted order. The process continues until all elements from both subarrays have been merged. \n",
    "\n",
    "Applications of Merge Sort:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sorting large datasets\n",
    "- External sorting (when the dataset is too large to fit in memory)\n",
    "- Inversion counting\n",
    "- Merge Sort and its variations are used in library methods of programming languages.\n",
    "- Its variation TimSort is used in Python, Java Android and Swift. The main reason why it is preferred to sort non-primitive types is stability which is not there in QuickSort.\n",
    "Arrays.sort in Java uses QuickSort while Collections.sort uses MergeSort.\n",
    "- It is a preferred algorithm for sorting Linked lists.\n",
    "- It can be easily parallelized as we can independently sort subarrays and then merge.\n",
    "- The merge function of merge sort to efficiently solve the problems like union and intersection of two sorted arrays.\n"
